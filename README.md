# Welcome to **Big Mood**
### **A Mood Based Content Generator**

In the wilderness of certain parts of the world, travelers can happen upon stacked stones, often at crossroads. The purpose of these stones are many, but one of their purposes is to comfort travelers on their journey and remind them that others have gone through the wilderness before them, to safety. Like these stones, Big Mood serves to calm and reassure, to offer guidance and give balance through mood-based content generation.

From time to time, everyone has to deal with feeling some kind of way that hinders their productivity or their overall satisfaction. We aren’t always sure what to do with our emotions. When we feel something intensely, like anger or sadness, we can be motivated to engage in unuseful behaviors in order to distract ourselves from this feeling. Some of these behaviors can include binge eating, engaging in destructive behavior, distancing ourselves from our loved ones and peers, over-engaging with social media, along with countless other options.

The modern world may be filled with readily accessible distractions for those who want them, but how many of those distractions are specifically tailored for what you’re feeling at any given time? With our app, Big Mood, we aim to resolve this issue through mood-based content generation. Users can save content they like to a list of favorites, which they can reference at a later time if they feel the need.
